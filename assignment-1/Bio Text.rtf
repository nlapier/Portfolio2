\f0\fs24 \cf0 Born and raised in Austin, TX, I studied economics at Trinity University before moving to New York City in 2010.   I am currently studying full stack web development at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp,  with the goal of working as a junior developer when I graduate in October.  I pay my bills working as a handyman on Taskrabbit, and a courier on UberRUSH. When I\'92m not coding or working, I like to explore, travel, volunteer, ride my bicycle and motorcycle, and plot to import breakfast tacos and the word \'93y\'92all\'94 to NYC.  }
